# Getting Started

## Features

### User Interaction

If you look at any header field on the page, you'll notice three little dots 
(called an elipsis) that if you mouse over, will open up to give you options
for Permalink, Edit this Page, and Ask a Question. 
These are to ensure that a user is able to link someone else directly to a section
of interest (Permalink), contribute a fix or suggestion to the documentation itself on GitHub
(Edit this page) or open up an issue that links directly to where the user has
the question. Documentation is hard, and sometimes unclear, and the site
should make it easy to ask a question or suggest a change.

### Search

The entire site, including posts and documentation, is indexed and then available
for search at the top of the page. Give it a try! The content is rendered
from [this file]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/search_index.json)
into [this json data structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/search_index.json)
that feeds into the search defined in `assets/js/application.js`. If you want to
exclude any file from search, add this to its front end matter:

```
---
layout: null
excluded_in_search: true
---
```

The example above is for a css file in the assets folder that is used as a template, but should not be included in search. If you need to disable search entirely for a page, you can add the `disable_search` header:

```
---
layout: null
disable_search: true
---
```

Disabling search will remove the search box at the top.


### External Search

If you have an external site with a search GET endpoint (meaning one that ends
in `?q=<term>`, then you can automatically link page tags to search this endpoint.
For example, on an HPC site I'd want a tag like "mpi" to do a search on 
[https://github.com](https://github.com) for mpi.
See the [tags](#tags) section below for how to configure this.


### Discourse Forum

If you have a discourse forum that you want to show questions from,
there is an [easy way](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embedding-a-list-of-discourse-topics-in-another-site/125911) to embed them here. Specifically, there is an include `{% raw %}{% include embed/discourse.html %}{% endraw %}` that is deployed at [/forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/forum/) and added to the table of contents under Extra -> Discussion Forum. You can add this include to wherever you want the questions to appear. The follow parameters are defined in the config.yml:

```yaml
discourse_site: "https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org" 
discourse_per_page: 10
discourse_category: "stanford-research-computing"
discourse_tags: null # comma separated string, leave null to not filter
```

For the above, we embed 10 topics from the stanford-research-computing category of AskCI, and render 10 per page. Since there are few topics, we don't filter down to tags. If we did, we should provide a list of comma separated values.

Note that you aren't required to only embed one category - you can easily modify the code to include more than one by copy pasting the `d-topics-list`.

{% include alert.html type="info" content="To use this for your discourse site, you must enable the 'embed topics' setting." %}


### Documentation

Documentation pages should be written in the `_wiki` folder of the repository,
and you are allowed to use whatever level of nesting (subfolders) that 
works for you! It's a Jekyll [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), which means that you
can add other content (images, scripts) and it will be included for linking to.

#### Organization

The url that will render is based on the path. For example, if we had the following structure:

```
_wiki/
  getting-started.md
  clusters/
     sherlock/
         getting-started.md
```

The first page (akin to the one you are reading) would render at it's path,
`/_wiki/getting-started/`.


#### Linking

From that page, we could provide the
direct path in markdown to any subfolder to link to it, such as the second
getting started page for sherlock:

```
{% raw %}[example](clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md){% endraw %}
```

in the same directory, and from that page you can test linking to a subfoldr.
In the case of not having a subfolder, we could write the link out directly:

```
{% raw %}[example]({{ site.baseurl }}/wiki/clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md){% endraw %}
```

or better, there is a shortand trick! We can use the provided "includes" 
template to do the same based on the path to create a link:

```
{% raw %}{% include wiki.html name="Sherlock Cluster" path="clusters/sherlock/getting-started" %}{% endraw %}
```
The path should be relative to the wiki folder.

#### Headers

You can previewer h1 h2 h3 toc on the right sidebar.

### Pages

The `pages` folder uses the same page layout, but is not part of the wiki collection.
The two are provided to create a distinction between website pages (e.g., about,
feed.xml) and documentation pages.  

### Navigation

If you want find your wiki on the left sidebar, please make sure you have added 
Front Matter with `title` variable on the top of your markdown file.

### News Posts

It might be the case that your site or group has news items that would
warrent sharing with the community, and should be available as a feed.
For this reason, you can write traditional [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) in the `_posts`
folder that will parse into the site [feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml)
The bottom of the page links the user to a post archive, where posts are organized
according to the year.

### Buttons

Buttons come in a nice array of colors. Here is the code for a basic example,
and you'd want to vary the `.btn-<tag>` to get different classes.

```html
<button class="btn btn-success">.btn-success</button>
```

<button class="btn btn-success">.btn-success</button>
<button class="btn btn-info">.btn-info</button>
<button class="btn btn-secondary">.btn-secondary</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary">.btn-primary</button>
<button class="btn btn-danger">.btn-danger</button>
<button class="btn btn-warning">.btn-warning</button>

### Badges

For news post items, it's nice to be able to tag it with something that indicates
a status, such as "warning" or "alert." For this reason, you can add badges to
the front end matter of any post page, and they will render colored by a type,
with the tag of your choice. For example, here is an example header for
a post:

```yaml
---
title:  "Two Thousand Nineteen"
date:   2019-06-28 18:52:21
categories: jekyll update
badges:
 - type: warning
   tag: warning-badge
 - type: danger
   tag: danger-badge
---
```

And here is the post preview with the rendered badges that it produces:

<span class="badge badge-warning">warning-badge</span>
<span class="badge badge-danger">danger-badge</span>

And the other badges that you can define include success, info, secondary,
and primary.

<span class="badge badge-success">success-badge</span>
<span class="badge badge-info">info-badge</span>
<span class="badge badge-secondary">secondary-badge</span>
<span class="badge badge-primary">primary-badge</span>

### Alerts

{% include alert.html type="info" title="What is an alert?" content="An alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary. This example is an info box, and the code for another might look like this:" %}

```
{%raw%}{% include alert.html type="info" title="Here is another!" %}{%endraw%}
```

Just for fun, here are all the types:


### Quotes

You can include block quotes to emphasize text. 

> Here is an example. Isn't this much more prominent to the user?

## Development

Initially (on OS X), you will need to setup [Brew](http://brew.sh/) which is a package manager for OS X and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). To install Brew and Git, run the following commands:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install git
```

If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, then you can easily install git with `apt-get`

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
```

### Install Jekyll

You can also install Jekyll with brew.

```bash
$ brew install ruby
$ gem install jekyll
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

On Ubuntu I do a different method:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
rbenv install 2.3.1
rbenv global 2.3.1
gem install bundler
rbenv rehash
ruby -v

# Rails
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
gem install rails -v 4.2.6
rbenv rehash

# Jekyll
gem install jekyll
gem install github-pages
gem install jekyll-sass-converter

rbenv rehash
```

### Get the code

You should first fork the repository to your GitHub organization or username,
and then clone it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/mywiki.git mywiki
$ cd mywiki
```

You can clone the repository right to where you want to host the docs:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/mywiki.git mywiki
$ cd mywiki
```


### Serve

Depending on how you installed jekyll:

```bash
jekyll serve
# or
bundle exec jekyll serve
```


### Preview

We provide a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) configuration recipe that you
can use to preview your site on CircleCI before merging into master. You
should follow the instructions to [set up a project](https://circleci.com/docs/enterprise/quick-start/),
and then in the project settings be sure to enable building forked build requests,
and to cancel redundant builds. The preview will be built on CircleCI, and saved
to static files for you to browse. The only change you will need is to edit
the static files location to be the name of your respository, which is at te
bottom of the `.circleci/config.yml` file:

```yaml
      - store_artifacts:
          path: ~/repo/_site
          destination: mywiki
```

In the above, the destination should coincide with your repository name.
Remember that for most links, CircleCI won't honor an `index.html` file in a subfolder
(e.g., `subfolder/index.html` will not be served as `subfolder/`, so for example,
you might need to turn this:

```
https://<circleci>/0/mywiki/wiki/getting-started/
```
into this:

```
https://<circleci>/0/mywiki/wiki/getting-started/index.html
```

## Customization

#### config.yml

To edit configuration values, customize the [_config.yml](_config.yml).
Most are documented there, and please [open an issue](https://www.github.com/{{ site.github_user }}/{{ site.github_user }}/issues) if you have questions.

#### Adding pages

To add pages, write them into the [pages](pages) folder. 
You define urls based on the `permalink` attribute in your pages.

#### Tags

If you include tags on a page, by default they won't link to anything. However,
if you define a `tag_search_endpoint` url in your configuration file, by clicking
the tag, the user will be taken to this page to search for it. As an example,
we define the current search endpoint to be Ask Cyberinfrastructure, and
page tags link to a search on it:

```yaml
tag_search_endpoint: https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/search?q=
tag_color: danger # danger, success, warning, primary, secondary, info
```

Note that you can also choose a color! The tags appear at the top of the page,
as they do on this page. The tags should be defined like this in the front end
matter:

```yaml
tags: 
 - jekyll
 - github
```

They are appended to the first h1 block, so generally your pages should have a header.

## Extra

### Quizzes

These are intended to help educate your users about the content of your documentation.
For a quiz, you can add a new file to the folder `_data/quizzes`, and write a 
questions file based on the format shown in `_data/quizzes/example-quiz.yml`.
Here is a simple example of a multiple choice question (which can also serve as 
True/False):

```yaml
title: This is the Quiz Title
randomized: false
questions:

 - type: "multiple-choice"
   question: "True or False, Pittsburgh is West of Philadelphia"
   items:
    - choice: True
      correct: true
    - choice: False
      correct: false
   followup: | 
      The answer is True! Pittsburgh is 304.9 miles West of 
      Philadelphia, or approximately a car ride of 
      4 hours and 52 minutes. Buckle up!
```

The quiz is rendered with a "Show Answer" button below each question, and when
the user clicks it, any questions that are flagged with `correct: true` will be 
bolded, and if a followup section is included, it will be displayed.
See the live example at the end of this page.

#### Options

##### Title

If you include a title, it will be rendered at the top of the quiz. This is
optional - you can leave it out and add it before the include on the page.

##### Random

If you want your questions to be presented randomly, just add randomized: true
to the data.

#### Example Quiz

If I want to include the quiz located at `_data/quizzes/example-quiz.yml`, I 
can do so like this:

```
{% raw %}{% include quiz.html file='example-quiz' %}{% endraw %}
```
